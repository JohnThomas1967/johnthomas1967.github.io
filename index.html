In Gotham City, mentally-troubled comedian Arthur Fleck is disregarded and mistreated by society. He then embarks on a downward spiral of revolution and bloody crime. This path brings him face-to-face with his alter-ego: "The Joker". Martin Scorsese may have influenced Joker, but writer/director Todd Phillips reveals that it was a specific era of cinema that inspired his and Joaquin Phoenix's take on the classic villain.
