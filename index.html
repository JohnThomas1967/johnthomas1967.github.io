Source:Wiki<p>The first Horrid Henry book was written by Francesca Simon and published in 1994 by Orion Books and, as of 2019, there will be twenty-five titles published, as well as many other collections, activity books and joke books. Novel Entertainment produced an animated television series for CITV. It is a slice-of-life series featuring the titular Henry, a self-centred, naughty boy who has issues with authority who will typically be faced with a problem and then will often retaliate in interesting ways that involve trickery, rule-breaking and elaborate practical jokes. Henry has a younger brother who he bullies called Perfect Peter, who is the exact opposite of Henry. Almost every character is known by an alliterative nickname (Rude Ralph, Moody Margaret, Brainy Brian etc.) with a few exemptions: (Mum and Dad).
